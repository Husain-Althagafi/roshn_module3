Started early this morning. Managed to get the waterproofing membrane installed on the basement Level B1 west wall by the specialized crew from Protech. They finished about 350 sqm which is ahead of schedule.

Steel fixers completed rebar installation for foundation pads FP-12 through FP-18 (total 7 pads). Inspection scheduled for tomorrow morning with the engineer.

INCIDENT REPORT: Around 11:30am one of the laborers (Mahmoud Hassan) reported minor hand injury while handling rebar. Small cut, first aid administered on site by safety officer. Worker returned to light duties after 30min break. No lost time. Reminded all crews about proper glove usage during safety briefing.

Material delivery for block C facade panels arrived late - was scheduled 8am but truck came at 1pm due to traffic on coastal road. Caused some crew downtime in the morning. Crane operator had to extend hours to unload.

Tower crane TC-02 developed hydraulic leak around 3pm. Maintenance team on site, they say parts needed. Crane out of service until Thursday. Will use mobile crane for critical lifts.

Overall: Decent day despite the delays.
