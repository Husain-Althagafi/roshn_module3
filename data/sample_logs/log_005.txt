SEDRA Site Log - Tower C Construction
October 19, 2025
Manager: Yousef Al-Qahtani

Weather Impact: Heavy rain from 6am to 11am. About 35mm recorded. All outdoor concrete work halted. Crews shifted to covered areas where possible.

Work completed despite weather:

Interior work in Tower C continued. Tiling crew installed ceramic tiles in 18 apartment bathrooms on levels 2 and 3. Approximately 280 sqm covered. Quality looks good.

Electricians pulled cables for power distribution on levels 4, 5, and 6. All conduits for these levels now have wiring. Ready for termination next phase.

Carpentry team built and installed custom cabinets for 6 apartment kitchens (units C-201 through C-206).

Exterior work (when rain stopped):

After lunch when rain cleared, masonry crew resumed blockwork on north facade Level 7. Completed about 40% of that level before end of shift.

Curtain wall installation team from Petroglaze installed 8 glass panels on south elevation Level 3. Working through the punch list slowly.

Issues:

The rain caused flooding in basement parking Level B2 near the sump pump area. Drainage system couldn't handle the heavy downpour. Facilities team pumped out water by end of day. Need to review drainage capacity with civil engineer - this is second time this month.

Waiting on building authority inspection for fire alarm system Level 1-5. Scheduled for Monday. Cannot proceed with ceiling closures until approved.

No safety incidents.
Workers: 94 (lower than usual due to weather)
