Site Supervisor: Hassan Al-Shammari

Morning started with safety toolbox talk - topic was working at heights. 45 workers attended.

Achievements today:

Foundation works: Concrete pour for foundation slab FS-05 completed. Total 180 cubic meters placed. Vibration and finishing done properly. Curing compound applied. This completes all foundations for Building 5 - major milestone!

Structural steel: Erection crew installed steel columns on grid lines A through E for ground floor. Total 12 columns erected and bolted. Surveyor confirmed alignment within tolerance.

MEP underground: Plumbing contractor laid 85 meters of underground sewage pipes from Building 5 to main line. Pressure testing passed.

External works: Landscaping subcontractor planted 47 trees along western boundary. Irrigation system for this zone now active.

Problems:

Quality issue identified during inspection. Some of the blockwork on Level 1 east wall not meeting standard - joints not filled properly, alignment off by 15mm in several spots. Informed masonry foreman. They will need to chip out and redo approximately 25 sqm of wall. This is unacceptable quality. Gave them 3 days to correct and re-inspect.

Also, elevator installer reported that elevator car for Shaft E-2 has wrong interior finish panels - they sent brushed steel but specs call for mirror finish. Panels being returned, correct ones will take 2 weeks to arrive. Elevator installation for this shaft now pushed to November.

Otherwise productive day. Total 103 workers on site.
