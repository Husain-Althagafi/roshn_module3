Project: MARAFY Canal District - North Sector
Site Lead: Omar Abdulaziz

Challenging day with multiple issues.

Completed work:
- Piling crew finished piles P-45 through P-52 (8 piles total) in zone N3
- Earthworks contractor completed grading for service road SR-04
- Installed 120m of storm drainage pipe along eastern boundary

Problems encountered:

1) CRITICAL BLOCKER: Concrete batch plant had breakdown this morning. Mixer motor failed. Plant offline from 9am to 4pm. Lost almost full day of concrete work. We had scheduled major pour for retaining wall RW-12 but had to postpone. This will cascade delay to following activities. Batch plant now running but we need to reschedule pour - coordinating with structural engineer.

2) Three workers from ABC Contracting showed up without proper site induction. Safety officer turned them away at gate. Contractor failed to submit paperwork in advance. Work they were supposed to do (formwork zone N2) now delayed by one day.

3) SAFETY INCIDENT: Near miss event at 2pm. Crane operator was lifting materials when load came close to striking scaffolding due to wind gust. Crane operations suspended for 1 hour, conducted safety review. Wind was 35 kph gusting to 45. Lifting operations resume only when wind below 30 kph as per our safety protocol.

4) Shortage of formwork ties reported by carpentry crew. They only have enough for 2 more days. Procurement team notified to expedite order.

Despite issues, team worked well. Morale still good.

Site population: 156 workers
