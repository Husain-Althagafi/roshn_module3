Project: SEDRA Residential - Tower B

Good progress today. The concrete pour for Level 4 slab was completed successfully by 2pm with Al-Bawani crew. Total 250 cubic meters poured with no issues. Formwork team from Almabani also finished installing forms for Level 5 columns - should be ready for rebar tomorrow.

Blockwork continues on schedule in Tower A. The masonry crew completed 85% of the walls on Level 3. Should wrap up remaining 15% by tomorrow noon.

One issue to report: We're still waiting on the electrical conduits for Level 2. Supply was supposed to arrive Monday but contractor says delayed until Friday due to supplier issue. This will push back MEP rough-in by 3-4 days. Informed project manager.

Weather was clear, 28°C. No rain delays.

Crew count: 87 workers on site
Equipment: All operational
